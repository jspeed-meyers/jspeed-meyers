### Hiya there :bowtie:

- 🔭 I’m currently head of Chainguard Labs at [Chainguard](https://www.chainguard.dev/), a software supply chain security startup. Our mission is to make the world's software supply chain secure by default.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning about containers and software vulnerabilities (👋 [Chainguard Images](https://github.com/chainguard-images)), linux distros and patching patterns (👋 [Wolfi](https://github.com/wolfi-dev/)), SBOMs (👋 [bom-squad](https://github.com/bom-squad)), and VEX (👋 [OpenVEX](https://github.com/openvex)).

- 👯 I’m always looking to collaborate on writings about open source software, computer security, software engineering, public policy, and other topics. Examples include ["Should Uncle Sam Worry about Foreign Open Source Software?"](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/should-uncle-sam-worry-about-foreign-open-source-software-geographic-known-unknowns-and-open-source) or ["Dependency Issues: Solving the World's Open Source Software Security Problem"](https://warontherocks.com/2022/05/dependency-issues-solving-the-worlds-open-source-software-security-problem/).

- 📖 I also like doing academic research too: like [understanding Python 🐍 malware detection](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/363888596_Bad_Snakes_Understanding_and_Improving_Python_Package_Index_Malware_Scanning) or asessing new [software signature systems](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3548606.3560596).
  
- ⚡ Fun fact: My middle name is Speed, seriously. Friends and family call me "John Speed," my first and middle name together. You should too, unless you don't want to.

- 📧 Email me at jsmeyers@chainguard.dev if I can be of service.
